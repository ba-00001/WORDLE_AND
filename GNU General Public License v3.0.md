# GNU General Public License

This section outlines certain terms and conditions of the GNU General Public License (GPL). Please note that this is a summary, and the full license text can be found [here](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.html).

## Section 12: No Surrender of Others' Freedom

If conditions contradicting this License are imposed on you, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot convey a covered work satisfying your obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then you may not convey it at all.

## Section 13: Use with the GNU Affero General Public License

You have permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single combined work. The terms of this License will continue to apply to the covered work, and the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License, section 13, will apply to the combination as such.

## Section 14: Revised Versions of this License

The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the GNU General Public License. Each version is given a distinguishing version number. You have the option to follow the terms and conditions either of that numbered version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation.

## Section 15: Disclaimer of Warranty

There is no warranty for the program, to the extent permitted by applicable law. The program is provided "as is" without warranty of any kind.

## Section 16: Limitation of Liability

In no event will any copyright holder or any other party who modifies and/or conveys the program as permitted above be liable to you for damages, including any general, special, incidental, or consequential damages.

## Section 17: Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16

If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms, reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates an absolute waiver of all civil liability.

### How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs

If you develop a new program and want it to be of the greatest possible use to the public, the best way is to make it free software under the GNU General Public License. To do so, attach the provided notices to the program and ensure proper documentation on how to contact you. Additionally, if the program does terminal interaction, make it output a short notice similar to the one mentioned above.

**Note:** The GNU General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into proprietary programs. If your program is a subroutine library, consider using the GNU Lesser General Public License.
